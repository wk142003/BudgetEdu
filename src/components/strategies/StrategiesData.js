    strategy: '50-30-20 Rule',
    explanation: 'Allocate 50% of income to needs (e.g., rent, groceries), 30% to wants (e.g., dining out, hobbies), and 20% to savings or debt repayment.',
    scenario: 'Best for individuals seeking a simple, balanced approach to budgeting without detailed tracking.',
    example: 'Emma earns $4,000 monthly. She budgets $2,000 for rent and bills, $1,200 for entertainment and dining, and $800 for savings and student loan payments.',
  },
  {
    strategy: 'Envelope System',
    explanation: 'Divide cash into envelopes for specific spending categories (e.g., groceries, utilities). Once an envelope is empty, no more spending in that category until the next period.',
    scenario: 'People who tend to overspend on variable and discretionary expenses, especially those who prefer a tangible and visual approach to managing their money over digital methods.',
    example: 'Mike allocates $300 cash for groceries and $100 for dining out each month. When the dining envelope is empty, he cooks at home until the next month.',
  },
  {
    strategy: 'Pay-Yourself-First System',
    explanation: 'Prioritize savings by setting aside a portion of income for savings or investments before paying other expenses, then budget the rest for needs and wants.',
    scenario: 'Great for savers who want to build wealth or an emergency fund but struggle to save after expenses.',
    example: 'Sarah earns $3,000 monthly. She transfers $600 to savings immediately, then budgets the remaining $2,400 for rent, bills, and fun.',
  },
  {
    strategy: 'Zero-Based Budgeting',
    explanation: 'Assign every dollar of income to a specific category (e.g., bills, savings, spending) so that income minus expenses equals zero each month.',
    scenario: 'Suitable for detail-oriented individuals who want complete control over every dollar and have variable expenses.',
    example: 'John earns $5,000 monthly. He allocates $2,500 to bills, $1,000 to savings, $1,000 to groceries and gas, and $500 to entertainment, ensuring every dollar is planned.',
